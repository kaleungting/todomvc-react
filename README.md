## TodoMVC â€¢ React

> **To Do or Not To Do...?**
> -Not Hamlet

That is the question.

This repository was based off of Felix Gnass's React Implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). The link to the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cellular/todomvc-react).

It is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

# Instructions
Running the application is so simple, even a fool can figure it out:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open up your browser and run it on **localhost:3000**

# Added Features
 **Search Bar** - type in your favorite to dos, and the unwanted ones will magically disappear (well, not magically)... 
   
 **Priority Sort** - whether you like the low hanging fruits or the high ones, this feature has got you covered!

# Future Improvements

 - Use of localstorage or a backend database to store todos
 - React Hooks
 - Updated dependencies (the ones from the original repo are a bit old)
