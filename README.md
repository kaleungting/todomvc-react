## TodoMVC â€¢ React

This repository was based off of Felix Gnass's React Implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). The link to the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cellular/todomvc-react).

The repository to his implementation can be found here and it is built on React, [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Running the application is simple:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open up your browser and run it on localhost:3000

Added Features:
Search Bar - type in your favorite to dos, and the unwanted ones will magically disappear (well, not magically)...
Priority Sort - whether you like the low hanging fruits or the high ones, this feature has got you covered!

Future Improvements:
Use of localstorage or a backend database to store todos.
React Hooks
Updated dependencies (the ones from the original repo are a bit old)
